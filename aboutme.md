title: About me
---

Hello, welcome to my page! I am Alex Leu, and here's some stuff about me:

I am a Data Science Engineer that focuses in Optimization @AdRoll Group.
- My go to language for productionized code is python, ad-hoc analysis in python,
    and staistical test in R.
- I have been learning Time Series Modeling lately, and hope to sharpen my
skill in it.
- Over spare time I build bots for my church(usher bot)
- I also learn Julialang on my spare time.
- I also like to run. I just finished full marathon in 2017.

### my interest
I am a natural science lifelong learner who recently discovered the beauty
of computer science. I started coding on my first job in sales operation,
realized manual daily tasks could be automated with programming, and the
ultimate result of automation led me to the world of computational statistic,
aka data science.

With this picture in mind, I was intrigued by this challenge to transform
an ideal world into reality. I started off with writing scripts and apps that
optimzied my work efficiency, which paved the way to codes that improved
the entire teams' daily tasks. As I moved from operational to
the BI side, I became even more fascinated by how data science could be utilized
to impact business models.

My passion is to create and optimize data algorithms that not only replace
manual nodes with data driven quality, but can also connect the full
data stream to make the best business executive decisions.

### my history

I graduated from UCLA back in 2014 in Biophysics. I used to work at Google
from an analyst to a business intelligence developer. In 2016, I switched
from business intelligence developer to data scientist @ AdRoll Group.
Afterwards, I became a Data Science Engineer, focus in Optimization.
